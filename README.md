# Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Approach
Sometimes, it is difficult to explicitly design programs that can recognize people or digits in images: Modeling the object structure, the physics, the variability, and the image formation process can be very difficult. Thus, instead of designing the programs by hand, we collect many examples that specify the correct outputs for different inputs. Then, a machine learning algorithm takes these examples and produces a program trained to give the answers we want. If designed properly, the program may work in new situations, not just the ones it was trained on.

## What is Machine Learning?
* Algorithms that allow machines to ”learn”. 
* Extract information automatically 
* Performing tasks not specifically programmed for. 
* Allowing machines to find their own patterns in data.

## When to use Machine Learning?
A machine learning approach is most effective when *the structure of the task is not well understood* ‐ or too
difficult to model explicitly ‐ but can be characterized by a **dataset** with strong statistical regularity.
Machine learning is also useful in **dynamic situations**, when the task is constantly changing, e.g. a robot operating in an unknown environment.
